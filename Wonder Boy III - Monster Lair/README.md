## Features
* **Auto Start:** Initiates the timer when you press "Start" on the "One or Two Player" selection screen.
* **Auto Split:** Automatically splits the timer during the black screen transitions between levels. However, in the final level, the timer splits when you touch the armor after defeating the final boss.
* **Auto Reset:** Resets the timer when you reset the emulator.

## Splits
**For the Auto Splitter to work properly, there must be 9 splits, one for each level.**

For example:
* Level 1
* Level 2
* Level 3
* Level 4
* Level 5
* Level 6
* Level 7
* Level 8

Optionally, you can use the `.lss` file found in this folder. There, all splits are already set up.
